            It is not a news that <span>a constellation</span> is a group of stars on the night sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            But did you know that officially there are only <span>88 constellations</span> that together covering the entire celestial sphere? And each constellation contains at least a hundred of stars!
          </p>
          <p>
            All constellations are grouped in <span>8 constellation families</span> by some defining characteristic, such as proximity on the celestial sphere, common historical origin, or common mythological theme.

            Professional astronomers describe stars using a variety of parameters, but we'll explore only three of them: 
            <ul>
              <li>distance</li>
              <li>apparent magnitude</li>
              <li>color index</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The fist one is the <span>distance to a star</span> from the Sun in parsecs.</p>
          <p>The <span>parsec</span> is the most common unit in astrometry. It is equal to about 3.26 light-years (30 trillion km or 19 trillion miles) in length.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="part">
        <div class="viz magnitudes"></div>
        <div class="note">
            <p>
              <span>The apparent magnitude</span> of a star is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>The brightest stars</span> in the night sky were said to be of first magnitude (m = 1), whereas <span>the faintest</span> were of sixth magnitude (m = 6), which is the limit of human visual perception.
            </p>
            <p>
               It means that <span class="yellow">the brightest</span> star doesn't equal to <span class="red">the nearest</span> star most of the time. An almoust all of the nearest stars are invisible for a human eye.
            </p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>
             <span>The color index</span> is a simple numerical expression that determines the color of an object, which in the case of a star gives its temperature. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span>smaller</span> the color index, the more <span class="blue">blue</span> (or hotter) the object is. Conversely, the <span>larger</span> the color index, the more <span class="red">red</span> (or cooler) the object is.

           Only <span>5069</span> of the 100'000 nearest stars  <span>can be seen by people</span> on Earth without the aid of a telescope
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>95%</span> of all the stars <span>are hidden</span> from a naked human eyes.
