            <span>A constellation</span> is a group of stars that are considered to form imaginary outlines or meaningful patterns on the celestial sphere, typically representing animals, mythological people or gods, mythological creatures, or manufactured devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span>88 modern constellations</span> are defined regions of the sky together covering the entire celestial sphere.
          </p>
          <p>
            All constellations are splited in <span>8 constellation families</span> by some defining characteristic, such as proximity on the celestial sphere, common historical origin, or common mythological theme.

            <span>The apparent magnitude</span> of a star is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value (i.e. inverse relation). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sun, at apparent magnitude of −27, is the brightest object in the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brightest stars in the night sky were said to be of first magnitude (m = 1), whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude (m = 6), which is the limit of human visual perception (without the aid of a telescope)

             <span>The color index</span> is a simple numerical expression that determines the color of an object, which in the case of a star gives its temperature. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The smaller the color index, the more blue (or hotter) the object is. Conversely, the larger the color index, the more red (or cooler) the object is.
